These are some programs I wrote when I found out, that there is an interface
in the /proc directory where you can manipulate it.

Currently there are 4 executables:
- tl-on & tl-off & tl-toggle: self explanatory
- tl-strobo: toggling the thinklight for a stroboscope effect
- tl-morse: given a string, tl-morse blinks the morse-code
